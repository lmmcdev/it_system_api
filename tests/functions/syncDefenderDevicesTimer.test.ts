/**
 * Unit tests for syncDefenderDevicesTimer
 *
 * NOTE: This test is marked as .skip() because timer triggers are difficult to test
 * in isolation. The timer function is a thin wrapper around the service layer,
 * which has comprehensive test coverage.
 *
 * Timer triggers are better tested through:
 * 1. Integration tests with the Azure Functions runtime
 * 2. Manual testing in deployed environments
 * 3. Comprehensive service layer tests (DefenderDeviceSyncService.test.ts)
